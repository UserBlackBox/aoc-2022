# Advent of Code 2022
This is a public repository of my 2022 Advent of Code solutions. I am trying to attempt as many problems as possible in C++ this year to improve my skills in that language (and also to study for my first CS final).

| Problem | Files and Notes |
| ------- | ---- |
| Day 1: Calorie Counting | `dec01.cpp` for `data/dec01` |
| Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors | `dec02.cpp` for `data/dec02` |
| Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization | `dec03.cpp` for `data/dec03` |
| Day 4: Camp Cleanup | `dec04.cpp` for `data/dec04` |
| Day 5: Supply Stacks | `dec05.cpp` for `data/dec05` |
| Day 6: Tuning Trouble | `dec06.cpp` for `data/dec06` |
| Day 7: No Space Left On Device | Wrote `dec07.cpp` to process `data/dec07` but the program did not work completely due to some memory issues. I used the parts of the C++ program that worked to clean up the input into `data/dec07.processed` for `dec07.py` to process and get the final answers |
| Day 8: Treetop Tree House | `dec08.cpp` for `data/dec08` |
